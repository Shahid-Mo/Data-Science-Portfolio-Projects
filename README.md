# Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating a wide range of data science and machine learning applications. From predicting car prices based on various features, analyzing and predicting diabetes in individuals, to forecasting New York City cab fares, each project delves into detailed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and predictive modeling.

## Projects Overview

### Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on building a predictive model for car prices based on various features like make, model, mileage, fuel type, and more. It explores different regression techniques and evaluates their performance to find the best predictor of car prices.

### Diabetes Data Analysis and Prediction
A deep dive into the diabetes dataset to analyze the relationship between different health metrics and diabetes outcomes. This project employs various classification algorithms to predict diabetes and assesses the accuracy and effectiveness of each model.

### NYC Cab Fare Predictor
An exploration into New York City cab fare data to predict fares based on factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, number of passengers, and time of day. This project applies several regression models and aims to optimize predictions for fare estimation.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone this repository using:
